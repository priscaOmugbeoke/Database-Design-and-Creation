# Database-Design-and-Creation
A new library has been built by a university, and a library database is needed to track the activities. The goal of this project is to design an entity relationship model for the proposed library database and create a database that stores and tracks data regarding books in the library, the authors of those books, the publishers of those books, and the students and employees who also borrow books from the library.
